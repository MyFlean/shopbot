# Taxonomy-Guided Category Path Inference - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a robust taxonomy-driven category path inference system that provides the LLM with structured F&B hierarchy to generate accurate, ranked category paths.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Hierarchical Taxonomy Integration
**File**: `shopping_bot/llm_service.py`

#### New Utilities Added
```python
def _get_fnb_taxonomy_hierarchical(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Load hierarchical F&B taxonomy and flatten for LLM prompt efficiency."""
    # Loads from shopping_bot/taxonomies/fnb_hierarchy.json or uses embedded fallback
    # Returns flattened structure: {food: {l2: [l3s]}, beverages: {l2: [l3s]}}
```

```python
def _flatten_fnb_taxonomy(self, hierarchical: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, List[str]]]:
    """Convert nested taxonomy to 2-level structure for prompt."""
    # Transforms user's hierarchical JSON to token-efficient format
```

#### Embedded Taxonomy
Complete F&B taxonomy embedded as fallback (lines 4776-4881):
- **Food**: 10 L2 categories, 60+ L3 subcategories
- **Beverages**: 3 L2 categories, 15+ L3 subcategories

### 2. Enhanced Tool Schema
**File**: `shopping_bot/llm_service.py` (lines 714-724)

**Before**:
```python
"category_paths": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {"type": "string"},
    "maxItems": 3,
    "description": "Full paths like 'f_and_b/food/light_bites/chips_and_crisps'"
}
```

**After**:
```python
"category_paths": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {"type": "string"},
    "minItems": 1,
    "maxItems": 3,
    "description": (
        "Ranked category paths from provided taxonomy (MOST relevant first). "
        "Format: 'f_and_b/{food|beverages}/{l2}/{l3}' or 'f_and_b/{food|beverages}/{l2}'. "
        "MUST exist in taxonomy. Return 1-3 paths ordered by relevance/likelihood."
    )
}
```

### 3. Comprehensive Categorization Examples
**File**: `shopping_bot/llm_service.py` (lines 694-796)

Added 15 taxonomy-backed examples covering:
- **Exact L3 matches**: "banana chips" → `["f_and_b/food/light_bites/chips_and_crisps"]`
- **Ranked alternatives**: "ice cream" → multiple tub/cup/kulfi paths
- **L2 fallbacks**: "frozen snacks" → `["f_and_b/food/frozen_foods"]`
- **Beverages branch**: "cold coffee" → `["f_and_b/beverages/tea_coffee_and_more/iced_coffee_and_tea"]`
- **Cross-L2 queries**: "healthy breakfast" → cereals + dairy paths
- **Specific categories**: chocolates, noodles, biscuits, spreads, etc.

### 4. Prompt Architecture Enhancement
**Files**: `shopping_bot/llm_service.py` (lines 2960-3210)

#### Taxonomy Injection
```xml
<fnb_taxonomy>
{
  "food": {
    "light_bites": ["chips_and_crisps", "nachos", ...],
    "frozen_treats": ["ice_cream_tubs", "kulfi", ...],
    ...
  },
  "beverages": {
    "sodas_juices_and_more": ["soft_drinks", "fruit_juices", ...],
    ...
  }
}
</fnb_taxonomy>
```

#### New Critical Rule
```xml
<rule id="category_paths_taxonomy" priority="CRITICAL">
category_paths MUST come from provided fnb_taxonomy only.
- Return 1-3 paths ranked by relevance (MOST likely first)
- Format: "f_and_b/{food|beverages}/{l2}/{l3}" or "f_and_b/{food|beverages}/{l2}"
- For ambiguous queries, include multiple plausible L3s
- Never hallucinate paths not in taxonomy
</rule>
```

#### Updated Examples
All follow-up examples now use full taxonomy paths:
```json
{
  "q": "banana chips",
  "category_group": "f_and_b",
  "category_paths": ["f_and_b/food/light_bites/chips_and_crisps"],
  ...
}
```

### 5. ES Query Builder Improvement
**File**: `shopping_bot/data_fetchers/es_products.py` (lines 199-294)

#### Enhanced Path Normalization
```python
def _normalize_path(path_str: str) -> str:
    """Normalize path: if already full format, use as-is; else extract relative."""
    # Detects full format: f_and_b/{food|beverages}/...
    # Preserves beverages vs food distinction
    # Falls back to legacy relative path handling
```

#### Key Improvements
1. **Beverages Support**: Correctly handles `f_and_b/beverages/...` paths (previously forced to `food`)
2. **Full Format Detection**: Recognizes and preserves LLM-generated full paths
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Still handles legacy relative paths
4. **Ranked Multi-Path**: Builds `bool.should` with `minimum_should_match: 1` for 1-3 paths

## Architecture Flow

```
User Query: "cold coffee"
    ↓
LLM Context:
  - Conversation history
  - User slots (budget, dietary, etc.)
  - F&B taxonomy (flattened JSON) ← NEW
  - 15 categorization examples ← NEW
  - Critical taxonomy rule ← NEW
    ↓
LLM Output (tool call):
{
  "q": "cold coffee",
  "category_group": "f_and_b",
  "category_paths": [
    "f_and_b/beverages/tea_coffee_and_more/iced_coffee_and_tea"
  ],
  ...
}
    ↓
ES Query Builder:
  - Detects full format path
  - Preserves "beverages" branch
  - Builds filter: bool.should with term/wildcard
    ↓
ES Query:
{
  "bool": {
    "filter": [
      {"term": {"category_group": "f_and_b"}},
      {
        "bool": {
          "should": [
            {"term": {"category_paths": "f_and_b/beverages/tea_coffee_and_more/iced_coffee_and_tea"}},
            {"wildcard": {"category_paths": {"value": "*f_and_b/beverages/tea_coffee_and_more/iced_coffee_and_tea*"}}}
          ],
          "minimum_should_match": 1
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Zero Hallucination Design
- LLM receives complete taxonomy in prompt
- Critical rule enforces "MUST exist in taxonomy"
- Examples demonstrate exact path formats
- 15 diverse examples cover edge cases

### 2. Intelligent Ranking
- Tool schema requires paths in relevance order
- Examples show ranking logic:
  - Generic queries → multiple alternatives ranked by popularity
  - Specific queries → single exact match
  - Ambiguous queries → L2-only fallback

### 3. Beverages Branch Support
- Full taxonomy includes `f_and_b/beverages/...`
- ES normalizer preserves beverages vs food distinction
- Examples cover beverage categorization

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- ES builder handles both full and legacy relative paths
- Existing queries continue to work
- Gradual migration path

### 5. Token Efficiency
- Taxonomy flattened from nested to 2-level structure
- ~400 tokens for complete F&B taxonomy
- Compact JSON format with minimal whitespace

## Testing Scenarios

### Exact Matches
```
"banana chips" → ["f_and_b/food/light_bites/chips_and_crisps"]
"peanut butter" → ["f_and_b/food/spreads_and_condiments/peanut_butter"]
"green tea" → ["f_and_b/beverages/tea_coffee_and_more/green_and_herbal_tea"]
```

### Ranked Alternatives
```
"ice cream" → [
  "f_and_b/food/frozen_treats/ice_cream_tubs",
  "f_and_b/food/frozen_treats/ice_cream_cups",
  "f_and_b/food/frozen_treats/kulfi"
]

"chocolate" → [
  "f_and_b/food/sweet_treats/chocolates",
  "f_and_b/food/sweet_treats/premium_chocolates"
]
```

### L2 Fallbacks
```
"frozen snacks" → ["f_and_b/food/frozen_foods"]
"healthy breakfast" → [
  "f_and_b/food/breakfast_essentials/muesli_and_oats",
  "f_and_b/food/dairy_and_bakery/yogurt_and_shrikhand"
]
```

### Beverages
```
"soft drinks" → ["f_and_b/beverages/sodas_juices_and_more/soft_drinks"]
"cold coffee" → ["f_and_b/beverages/tea_coffee_and_more/iced_coffee_and_tea"]
"fruit juice" → ["f_and_b/beverages/sodas_juices_and_more/fruit_juices"]
```

## Observability

### Debug Logs Added
```python
print(f"DEBUG: CAT_PATH_FILTER | using category_paths.keyword exact terms")
# or
print(f"DEBUG: CAT_PATH_FILTER | using wildcard on category_paths (no .keyword)")
```

### Validation Points
1. **Tool Output**: `CORE:LLM2_OUT_FULL` logs show returned paths
2. **ES Query**: Filter construction visible in debug mode
3. **Path Detection**: Full vs relative path handling logged

## Migration & Deployment

### Phase 1: Deploy (Immediate)
- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing relative paths still work
- New LLM calls will use taxonomy

### Phase 2: Monitor (Week 1)
- Track `category_paths` in LLM output logs
- Validate paths exist in taxonomy
- Monitor hallucination rate

### Phase 3: Optimize (Week 2+)
- Analyze which L2/L3 categories get most traffic
- Refine example set based on real queries
- Consider A/B test for validation layer

### Optional: External Taxonomy File
To override embedded taxonomy:
```bash
mkdir -p shopping_bot/taxonomies
# Place your fnb_hierarchy.json here
```
